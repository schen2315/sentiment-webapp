# Sentiment-webapp
-This website calculates an overall sentiment score towards a subject in a given location
## ToDo:
* Adding relevant tweets to a sentiment score
* Comparing the sentiment scores of a given topic for two or more locations
* More complex learning features/ algorithm
* A way to validate my algorithm/ app -> how does it compare to something similar?
